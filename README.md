# Flickr-Image-search-with-Lightbox
This website has two search engines wich allows the user to seek for photos and how many the user wants. When it is clicked the images is going to be shown in lightbox. I devided the API keys into a module for future projects. In css I used media queries to make the webasite responsive.
