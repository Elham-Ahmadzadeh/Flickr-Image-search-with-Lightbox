# Flickr-Image-search-with-Lightbox
This website has two search engines wich allows the user to seek for photos and how many photos the user wants. When every image is clicked the image is going to be shown in lightbox. I divided the API keys into a module for future projects. In css I used media queries to make the website responsive.
